Here's a simple PowerPoint presentation outline for your **Invitation Card Generator** project. I'll give you the content slide by slide. You can copy this into PowerPoint or Google Slides.

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title:
Invitation Card Generator using Python

Subtitle (optional):
A GUI-based tool to create custom invitation cards

Presented by:
Your Name
Your Institution (if any)

Slide 2: Introduction

What is it?
A Python application that allows users to create personalized invitation cards by:

* Adding a background image
* Inserting a logo
* Automatically generating event details

* GUI-based interface (using Tkinter)
* Support for custom background and logo
* Auto-generated invitation layout with:

  * Decorative border
  * Title and event text
* Saves the final card as an image
* Previews the invitation using Matplotlib

Slide 4: Technologies Used

Python
PIL (Pillow): For image manipulation
Tkinter: For GUI development
Matplotlib: For displaying the invitation card

Slide 5: How It Works

1. User selects a background image (optional)
2. User selects a logo image (required)
3. Application generates a card:

   * Adds background

Future Improvements:

* Customizable text input fields
* More templates and styles
* Export as PDF

Slide 9: Conclusion

* A simple and creative way to generate invitation cards using Python
* Great project to learn image processing, GUI, and file handling
